<h1>Killer whales are smart masterminds and they are sharks no.1 predator.</h4>
<h1>We are making them scared by taking them away from their family and taking them so we can see them do tricks and it can become very sad and hearbreaking</h1>
<h1>There are videos of Killer whales banging their head on the gate or wall trying to get to the ocean and nobody was help[ing or saying free him all they did wa just laugh and watch her bleed</h1>
<h1>Orcas are fascinating creatures and they have the mind of a human</h1>
<h1>Penguins try to swim as fast as they can when they step foot in the water to try and dodge the big sea creatures. Some are lucky some are not and the lucky ones cann enjoy their time eating fish while the dead ones are in the skies roaming around knowing that they are safer than the penguins alive.</h1>
  <h1>There are many other smart creatures but the killer whales are the smartest</h1>
