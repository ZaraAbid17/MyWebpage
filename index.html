<p>Killer whales are smart masterminds and they are sharks no.1 predator.
We are making them scared by taking them away from their family and taking them so we can see them do tricks and it can become very sad and hearbreaking
There are videos of Killer whales banging their head on the gate or wall trying to get to the ocean and nobody was help[ing or saying free him all they did wa just laugh and watch her bleed
Orcas are fascinating creatures and they have the mind of a human</h1>
Penguins try to swim as fast as they can when they step foot in the water to try and dodge the big sea creatures. Some are lucky some are not and the lucky ones cann enjoy their time eating fish while the dead ones are in the skies roaming around knowing that they are safer than the penguins alive.
  There are many other smart creatures but the killer whales are the smartest</p>
<h1>well now im gonna talk about mushrooms because,i wrote too much for killer whales and that is all i can remember of the killer whales</h1>
<h1>Mushrooms</h1>
  <p>Mushrooms come in all sizes,colours,shape and some can glow in the dark!
 You can find mushrooms in your garden or in a forset.The forest ones are the  best because,they are the glow in the dark ones and they are colourful unlike the plain one in the gardens.Many people buy or find mushrooms that are not poisonous to cook for food psst you can find them in pasta and they taste disgusting.So if you ever find or buy a mushroom,make sure it isn't poisonous</p>
